This error occurs when you use a state variable inside a function component without declaring it using the `useState` hook. This often happens when you accidentally try to modify the state variable directly without using the setter function returned by `useState`. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const count = 0; // Incorrect - not using useState

  const increment = () => {
    count++; // Incorrect - directly modifying state
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
This code will not update the UI because the `count` variable is not managed by React's state system.  The `count` variable is treated as a local variable and modifying it won't trigger a re-render.
